Code for the microcontroller present on NDAQ modules which is the main processor for the Slow Cotrol system. Basically, the MCU behaves like a bridge between CAN (Controller Area Network) messages and SPI commands. Acting as CAN node, the system is accessible by a control application that implements full I/O operations to peripheral devices on the electronic module. Those devices are  connected to the MCU's SPI port.
